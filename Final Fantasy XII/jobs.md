### Strongest Job Combination

**Shikari / Foebreaker**\
This job combination makes it to the top of the list for two key reasons. The first reason is that the Foebreaker has access to all four "break" abilities (Addle, Expose, Shear and Wither). These abilities on their own are extremely strong and are very useful during the most difficult battles of the game.

The Shikari job allows access to some of the stronger weapons and accessories -- namely to ninja swords and to the [**Genji Gloves**](https://jegged.com/Games/Final-Fantasy-XII/Equipment-and-Items/Accessories/#Genji-Gloves). It also provides access to the three Swiftness Licenses making this job combination nearly unstoppable.

**Knight / Bushi**\
The Knight and Bushi combination is great because the two jobs offset one another's weaknesses. The Bushi relies on katana swords as the primary weapon which do damage based on strength as well as a character's magick power stat. This combination of jobs increases the amount of damage done by utilizing the strength from the Knight class and the higher Magick stat from the Bushi class.

This job combination also has access to a few different White Magick spells for healing and to the three Swiftness Licenses.

**White Mage / Machinist**\
Every party should have a White Mage for obvious reasons, but why pair it with the Machinist? The Machinist uses guns to do damage and the amount of damage that a gun does is not based on your stats; it is based on the type and level of the gun equipped, which makes it a useful weapon for a character that will not have high strength or be wearing heavy armor (like a White Mage).

This job combination will give the White Mage a decent means of adding to your party's damage when they are not casting curative spells.

**Black Mage / Red Battlemage**\
The strongest offensive Magick user combination. Magick users received a number of buffs in the Zodiac Age version of the game, from the way that MP now scales and lasts longer, to the amount of damage that can be done due to the increased Magick-based Licenses on the different License Boards. The amount of damage that this job combination can accomplish is ridiculously high.

**Black Mage / Monk**\
An alternative to the Black Mage / Red Battlemage combination is to swap the Red Battlemage class for the Monk class. The Monk class provides an increase in HP, strength and all three Swiftness Licenses. This allows the character to do damage without always expending MP and casting spells.

**Shikari / White Mage**\
You can use this job combination to create a nearly unstoppable tank. The Shikari has access to high amounts of HP granting Licenses, access to Shields and access to all of the healing spells that are needed to keep a tank alive.

**Shikari / Bushi**\
Less powerful than the Shikari / Foebreaker combination, but it does provide the Bushi (Samurai) access to ninja swords rather than Katanas, which is a combination that will come in extremely useful during the battle against [**Yiazmat**](https://jegged.com/Games/Final-Fantasy-XII/Clan-Primer/Hunts/Hunt-45-Farewell-to-a-Legend-Yiazmat.html). Just equip a [**Yagyu Darkblade**](https://jegged.com/Games/Final-Fantasy-XII/Equipment-and-Items/Weapons/#Yagyu-Darkblade) and [**Black Robes**](https://jegged.com/Games/Final-Fantasy-XII/Equipment-and-Items/Armor/#Black-Robes) (which increase Dark-elemental damage by 50%).

### Worst Jobs

It is important to note that, while it is possible to complete a playthrough of the entire game with these jobs, the Machinist and Uhlan jobs have some serious limitations. As mentioned above, the Machinist uses guns to inflict damage and gun damage is not based on any specific character stat, which means that the Machinist's damage output will be limited. The Uhlan uses spears as the primary weapon. Spears can do some half-decent damage, but the animation times for each attack are abnormally long, making the Uhlan a less ideal job to select.

### Recommended Combination to Use All Jobs

I would recommend using either of the following setup if your intention is to use all jobs across your six characters:

-   Shikari / Foebreaker
-   Uhlan / Machinist
-   Archer / Red Battlemage
-   Knight / Bushi
-   White Mage / Time Battlemage
-   Black Mage / Monk

Alternatively, the following combination may work:

-   Shikari / Foebreaker
-   Bushi / Knight
-   White Mage / Machinist
-   Black Mage / Monk
-   Uhlan / Time Battlemage
-   Red Battlemage / Archer
