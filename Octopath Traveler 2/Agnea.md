### Talent
Agnea's Talent is Dance Session. If she has allured a townsperson with her Day Path action, they will grant an additional effect when Agnea uses Lion Dance, Peacock Strut or Dagger Dance. In the first two cases, they will provide the benefit to the targeted party member (or a random party member if the effect is spread). In the latter, they will target Agnea instead.

This does not require the townsperson to be summoned into battle and can be used infinitely until they leave through normal means. Each recruitable person provides one specific effect, which is listed below their normal signature move when viewing them through her Path actions.

### Subjobs
Merchant turns Agnea into the best JP and money farmer in the game. The subjobs is normally limited by its farming skills being single-target, but she can make them party-wide with her main job's Divine Skill, Sealticge's Seduction and her Latent Power, All Together Now; which can be spammed using the Merchant's Full Power support skill to refill her Latent Power at start of combat.

Scholar gives Agnea a wide array of elemental coverages, Fire, Ice, and Lightning, which is supplemented by her natively having Wind magic. This subjob additionally comes with a wide variety of buffs, turning Agnea into an even more potent support character, capable of taking even greater advantage of The Show Goes On and Invigorate And Inspire.

Cleric can be a good choice for similar reasons as scholar, though this subjob heavily restricts her offensive flexibility.

Thief can take advantage of Agnea having the highest base speed in the game, turning her from support-character into a damage-dealer. Aeber's Reckoning deals damage based on the user's Speed and the Incidental Attack support skill can be attached to any Agnea build for a bit of extra damage.

Apothecary & **Inventor** both have powerful single-target skills, giving them great synergy with Agnea's Latent Power, All Together Now. While these subjobs are typically recommended for Partitio and Throné, as their Latent Powers allow for their single-target abilities to be used more frequently, an alternative answer is turn them into party-wide ones. The obvious drawback to this build - regularly refilling Latent Power - is addressed by Agnea's Invigorate And Inspire ability as well as the Inventor's Tin Horn.
