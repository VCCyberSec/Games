### Talent
Castti's Talent is Concoct. It allows her to use materials to create compounds during battle, which have effects dependent on the ingredients used By default, Castti is able to use up to 2 ingredients, however she can use BP to add additional ingredients, up to 5 maximum.

### Latent Power
Castti's Latent Power is Every Drop Counts, which allows her to concoct without consuming any of the ingredients used. 

### Subjobs
**Cleric** is the obvious choice to further increase Castti's viability as a backline healer. Besides the obvious boost in flexibility, Castti has the second highest Elemental Defense stat after Temenos, and healing spells scale by that stat, so she'll get a lot of use out of her SP. Finally, it results in the amusing visual presentation of Castti as an axe-wielding nun.

Dancer is a less obvious choice, but this job's Sealticge's Seduction skill will allow Castti's many single-target skills to become party-wide ones. In addition, the subjob's buffs supplement her own Concoct abilities.

Armsmaster will turn Castti into a tough as nails all-rounder. Though the Apothecary is nominally a backline support character, its high HP and Physical Attack lead to Castti spending a lot more time in melee combat than you might expect, and Armsmaster gives her every weapon type. Her newfound excellence at Breaking foes will also keep her Latent Power topped up, and Inspiriting Break will allow her to keep her SP full as well.

Warrior becomes a viable option once Castti obtains her Ex-Skill, Drastic Measures. Since the ability consumes debuffs the target is afflicted with to deal damage, the idea is to inflict the target with as many debuffs as possible to inflict maximum damage. Warrior's strong PA buff and final Support Skill, Deal More Damage, helps with this by raising the damage cap from 9,999 to 99,999.
