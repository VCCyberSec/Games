### Talent
Hikari's Talent, Learned Skills, lets him master skills during Challenges and use them in battle.

To Challenge someone, use Hikari's Day Path Action Challenge by pressing the Y button near a townsperson. Best them in duel to learn their skills!

### Latent Power
With Shadow's Hold, Hikari can deal large amounts of continuous damage to enemies.

Use this when Hikari's Latent Power Gauge is full. This gauge can be charged passively throughout the battle by taking damage and breaking foes.

### Subjobs
The best Secondary Job for Hikari is **Armsmaster.** To get this build, you need to have at least one Rusty Weapon in your posession. Once you have a Rusty Weapon, head for Gravell, Wildlands and knock out the Debt Collector standing outside the Retired Blacksmith's house.

After knocking out the Debt Collector, head inside the house and talk to the Retired Blacksmith. She will forge your Rusty Weapon into a Divine Weapon and give you the Proof of the Armsmaster. Equip the job to Hikari by going to the Job menu.

All you need to do next is to find the other 5 Rusty Weapons to unlock all of the Armsmaster's Job Skills. Make sure to equip the Divine Weapons to Hikari so he can use the Armsmaster Job Skill associated with it.
