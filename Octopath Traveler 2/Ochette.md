### Talent
Ochette's Talent is Capture/Prepare. It allows her to capture monsters during battle, and later summon them in battle, or prepare them and turn them into items. Ochette can attempt to capture certain monsters in battle with a given probability based on the monster's health, or can automatically capture monsters she defeated with a 25% chance. Captured monsters can be added to Ochette's roster, which can hold up to 5 at a time. Each monster has a specific skill associated with them, which they will use when Ochette summons them in battle. Unlike H'aanit, Ochette can summon monsters unlimited times without releasing them into the wild, with dungeon bosses being summoned once per battle. Additionally, captured monsters can be prepared into items, which consumes the monster converts it into specific items dependent on the type of monster. 

### Latent Power
Ochette's Latent Power is Animal Instincts, which allows her to use certain special skills without consuming SP.

**Beastly Claws:** A powerful physical attack on all foes.

**Beastly Howl:** Reduce all kinds of defense on all foes. Also reduce their Shield points regardless of their weakness.
Beastly Fangs: A highly powerful physical attack on a single foe.

### Subjobs
**Warrior** plays to Ochette's strengths as a primarily weapons user. In the first place, Hunter's base toolkit is only viable for exploiting bow weaknesses. However, by adding Warrior as a subjob, Ochette can wield two more weapon types and gains access to many powerful skills, turning her from a shield-breaker into a genuine damage-dealer.

Armsmaster gives Ochette the ability to wield every weapon type, supplementing her primary role as a shield-breaker. Since she is already capable of dealing lightning damage, by utilizing captured beasts for the remaining five elements, this subjob allows Ochette to exploit all twelve weaknesses by herself.

Thief is an alternative option. As Ochette has the highest native Accuracy, this subjob can augment this with increased Critical Hit rates. It also allows her to supplement Leghold Trap with Armor Corrosive, centralizing some of the most important debuffs in one character. Also, since buffs to not affect Ochette's captured beasts, Armor Corrosive is the only way to increase the damage dealt by Provoke.

Inventor's first Support Skill, A Step Ahead, works well on any character, since it allows them to automatically go first at the start of combat. However, this subjob has nothing else to offer Ochette and it might thus be best to move on once the skill has been acquired.
