### Subjobs
Merchant is a worthwhile choice on Osvald for multiple reasons. On top of giving him access to Spears and Bows, it also provides him with the Rest Skill to restore SP. When mugging, Sidestep is great for fighting physical combatants by letting Osvald build up BP without taking damage. The real showstopper, however, is Hired Help, which can deal massive damage regardless of user's own stats and level, so long as they got the money for it. This means Osvalt can mug high difficulty targets early game, giving him access high-quality equipment, provided he survives until the target is broken and has gathered 3 BP to fully boost Hired Help.

Apothecary is a strong subjob on Osvald. Like Merchant, it provides strong self-sustain to via Healing Touch, not to mention increased HP and bulk, and increases his weapon coverage by giving him Axes. Most importantly, however, is its support skills Vigorous Victor and Inspiriting Break which restore his HP and SP after combat, Mugging included, and when he breaks a target respectively.

Arcanist gives Osvald access to every element except Wind, all of whom can be buffed with Advanced Magic or Alephan's Enlightenment, turning him into a breaking machine. It also lets him equip the Mooneater dagger, which has one of the strongest Elemental Attack stats of any weapon on top of strengthing his Fire damage. The subjob's Seal Of Diffusion skill works very well with Stroke Of Genius, allowing him to buff the entire party. In addition, Blessing and Malice give Osvald SP and HP recovery while also doing damage respectively. Finally, the Of Equal Might Support Skill equalizes his base strength and elemental stats, depending on which is higher.

**Cleric** is an alternate choice if Arcanist is unavailable. Like Arcanist, it futher increases Osvalt's Elemental stat and gives him an additional element in Light. This subjob also gives multiple healing options while Mythical staff provides a way to recover SP. However, it offers no additional weapon types and Osvalt has no way to offset the job combo's issues, like low health.

Armsmaster can be a surprisingly strong choice for Osvald as this allows him to take advantage of the many weapons which increase the strength of an elemental attack. For example, by equipping the Guardian's Ice Blade, Battle-tested Axe, and Absolute-Zero Bow, he can boost the power of Icewind three separate times.

Conjurer helps minimize SP consumption. Its unique Conjure Skills give the entire party an additional hit of Fire, Ice, Lightning, or Wind damage after a weapon attack based on their elemental stat, of which Osvald has the highest of any character. Also, the subjob's SP Saver Support Skill straight-up halves the SP costs of Skills.
