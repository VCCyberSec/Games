### Talent
Partitio's talent is Business Partners. Unlike most other talents, it's not strictly limited to battle effects. Whenever he hires a townsperson through his Night Path action, they provide an additional effect to specific money-related activities. These can be used infinitely as long as they remain a companion and does not require them to be summoned in battles, if they provide a bonus to battle skills (such as Collect and Hired Help). They will not trigger if another party member uses related skills.

Benefits related to purchases, sales etc only trigger if Partitio is in the current active party lineup, however. Each townsperson has a specific benefit, which is shown below their usual stats when viewing them through Partitio's path actions.

However, due to the nature of the objective that requires Partitio to purchase the steam engine rights in his final chapter, his Business Partners ability will be locked for this event even if he has hired an NPC that grants a discount to any purchases, making it impossible to save a percentage of the leaves that are received from Alrond. 

### Latent Power
Hoot and Holler: Partitio's BP is replenished to the max. 

### Subjobs
**Arcanist's** Seal of Diffusion turns Partitio's self-buffs into party-wide ones. For example, being able to use an AOE Rest allows him to restore HP and SP to all party members for free. Otherwise, a party-wide Sidestep grants complete immunity to all physical attacks.

Warrior's Incite and Vengeful Blade can be combined with Partitio's innate Sidestep to draw, dodge and counter all incoming attacks.

Thief's Armor Corrosive debuff is one of the few ways to increase the damage from Partitio's innate Hired Help, since buffs do not affect that Skill. This combination also makes Partitio an expert money farmer, centralizing his innate Collect and the subjob's Steal in one character. Finally, this combo opens an unorthodox way to keep track of enemy health, since the success rate of both these money collecting skills increases when enemies are at low health.

Scholar becomes a viable option after Partitio unlocks his EX Skill, Share SP, allowing him to use the subjob's Alephan's Enlightenment on elemental damage users as well as keeping their SP topped off.

Cleric, much like Scholar, allows Partitio to become an SP battery after he unlocks his EX Skill, Share SP. In fact, it is arguably better in this area, since the subjob's Mystical Staff Skill allows him to refill his own SP and ensure that he always has enough to give away. However, it comes at the cost of losing damage increasing buffs, forcing another character to pick up the slack and costing an extra turn.

Inventor is often recommended to Partitio since the subjob benefits from his Latent Power, Hoot and Holler, allowing him to extend the subjobs many buffs.
