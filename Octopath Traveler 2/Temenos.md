### Talent


### Latent Power
**Judgement:** Breaks foe's Shield Points easily with any attack regardless of their weaknesses. Also bypass any Locked weaknesses. 

### Subjobs
**Scholar** works very well with Temenos' base kit. His Latent Power, Judgment, combined with a fully boosted Elemental Barrage allows him to break as many as eight Shield Points at once. Otherwise, he can use Advanced Magic and Alephan's Wisdom to make his party-wide spells hit two more times, allowing him to break three shields on all enemies; both tactics he can spam using the following Support Skills: Merchant's Full Power to recharge his Latent Power at the start of combat alongside Apothecary's Vigorous Victor and Inspiriting Break to regain SP at the end of combat and when breaking enemies. This subjob also gives Temenos access to four elements, Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Light, though the only weapons he can use are staves.

Armsmaster and its Sixfold Strike can also be used to win Coerce attempts with ease. However, this combination is less viable in full-party combat unless you plan to use Sealticge's Seduction which makes Sixfold Strike an AOE that breaks 6 Shield Points without boosting and can be used on the first turn.

Apothecary can turn Temenos into a healing menace by giving him both single-target and party-wide heals. This allowing him to be parsimonious with his SP and gives him additional combat prowess due to the subjob's higher Physical Attack and the flexibility of Axes. It also grants Temenos the ability to heal status effects, filling in the gap in his healing abilities.

Thief is a good all-around choice. Fighting is NOT what Temenos does, but the Speed boost is a valuable supplement to the natively slow Cleric class. Also, by using Cleric's Mystical Staff to regain SP and Thief's HP Thief to regain HP, he becomes fully self-sufficient.

Inventor's first Support Skill, A Step Ahead, works well on any character, since it allows them to automatically go first at the start of combat. However, this subjob has nothing else to offer Temenos and it is thus be best to move on once the skill has been acquired.
