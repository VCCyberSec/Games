### Talent
**Blessing of Darkness**

Grants all allies augmenting effects at night. 
This Talent can only be activated during battle at Nighttime.  The Talent applies the following effects on all allies at the beginning of battle, prior to any actions being taken:  
* Increased Speed for 3 turns   
* Increased Elemental Attack for 3 turns   
* Increased Physical Attack for 3 turns

### Latent Power
Leave No Trace - Throné can act twice in a single turn.

### Subjobs
**Dancer** is a good option as this supplements Throné's naturally high speed, allowing Aeber's Reckoning to be more powerful. It also gives her access to most buffs available, as well as the wind element. No new weapons are acquired, but the practicality of the AOE Dagger Dance skill and Ruinous Kick make up for that.

Hunter is a great choice for Throné, as Leghold Trap complements her other debuffing abilities. The class also allows her to equip Axes and Bows, allowing her to exploit four of six weapon weaknesses.

Cleric is surprisingly good on Throné. While her healing is diminished compared to Temenos and Castti, the ability to restore SP with the subjob's Mystical Staff Skill combined with her innate HP Thief to restore HP makes her self-sufficient in combat, keeping up her resources whilst maintaining damage output. This combo also centralizes the Light and Shadow element in a single character.

Inventor pairs very well with Throné's Latent Ability, Leave No Trace, speeding up the cooldown timer on the subjob's Skills. Notable synergies include: Springy Boots powering up her innate Surprise Attack Skill, Akar's Coil for healing, SP recovery, and extra BP while also being able to attack when paired with her Latent Power, Elemental Bomb Bottle for breaking, and the subjob's Divine Skill, All Purpose Tool, to use all active Skills in a single turn.
